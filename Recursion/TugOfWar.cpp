// You are a coach of a group consisting of 'N' students. The ith student has a strength Arr[i]. 
// For a Tug of War game, you want to divide students into two teams of equal size (If N is odd, 
// then size of one team should be (N-1)/2 and size of other team should be (N+1)/2). You want 
// a game that is fun, for this the absolute difference between the teamâ€™s strength should be as 
// minimum as possible. A team's strength is the sum of the strengths of the students in the team.
